## Description

AS a group that loves movies we wanted to be able to share our love of movies with the world by writing reviews and sharing our ratings.

We created an app that allows a user to create an account and login using that account.  Once that user is logged in they have the ability to see the top 50 rated movies on IMDB.  They also have the ability to write/store/ delete reviews on the top 50 movies as well as any movie they would like.

The user will also have the ability to create a profile page where they can upload a picture and their reviews will be stored.

Create a user, login and write some reviews.

We'd love to hear your movie thoughts!!



## Installation

If you are launching the site from the heroku app you can access it here:<br>

https://peaceful-plateau-13571.herokuapp.com/<br>

Once there you are able to login and use the functionality.

The other way to use our app is by using the node.js terminal.  You can begin by downloading from our github:<br>

https://github.com/JLEAR749/reelzgoodreviews.git<br>

Once this is in your visual studio you can open a terminal and execute 'npm i' to install the packages.  Next you can create a database called 'reviews_db.  You can then execute 'npm run seed' to seed the database.  Next you can execute 'npm start'.  This will start the server listening and you can then take the hyperlink and launch it in Chrome.  You can then access the movies as mentioned above.


## Usage

GitHub Link:  https://github.com/JLEAR749/reelzgoodreviews.git <br>
Heroku Link:  https://peaceful-plateau-13571.herokuapp.com/

When a user opens the page they are presented with a signup/ login form.  If the user has already created an account they can use the login and access their profile and their movie review/ rating dashboard.  If the user doesn't have an account they can create one by entering a Username, Email, and Password.

Once logged in they have the ability to see the movies on the Home page which is the top 50 rated movies by IMDB 

The user can then go to the dashboard page and create reviews for any movie they would like - they then have the ability to write more reviews or delete the most recent or past reviews.
